# createUser

This is a simple program that simulates retrieving data from a database by using Promises and setTimeout.

The program will continue to run and accept new users before the data is fully retrieved. 

While creating new users, the program will ensure that there are no duplicate usernames anywhere.

Once the data is done retrieving, the new users will be added to the list.

Any errors will be caught and displayed in the console
